# ðŸ§  Language Model Integration with Wav2Vec2 for Oromo and Amharic

This project boosts **Wav2Vec2** speech recognition models using a **KenLM 5-gram language model**, enhancing decoding quality for **low-resource African languages** such as Oromo and Amharic.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Download or prepare `.arpa` language models.
- Build a binary KenLM (`.bin`) for fast decoding.
- Use `pyctcdecode` to attach the LM to Wav2Vec2.
- Save the enhanced `Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM`.
- Upload the processor to Hugging Face with Git LFS.
